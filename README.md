# Bike Sharing

## Overview 

Our friend recently got back from a trip to NYC where she fell in love with riding bikes around for public transportation. In fact, she loved it some much that she wanted to see if having a city bike model would work in the boring Midwest. We were tasked to help her study the Demographic and city bike model from NYC and then use those conclusion to compare to the her city. We used a free software called Tableau and pulled the data from an online database. The data consisted of lat and long coordinates, gender, age, trip duration, etc. Below are 7 different visuals we used to share the data we collected. 

### Activity Per Station 

The image below is a map of each station in MYC based on the lat and long. Additionally, the location dots are colored based off of how popular each location is regarding to ride count. As you can see, there is a hub of high activity in the heat of the city, where as you move out from the city it isn't that popular.

### Rides by Gender

The image below is a bar graph that seperates ride count by gender. This is important for the marketing team to be able to increase market share within genders or double down on marketing. As you can see, most of the riders are male.

### Rides by Age

Below is a line graph that plots ride count by age. This is important to determine you target age group. The peak age group is between 25 and 45 years old. However, there is a something wrong with the data around age 52 as there is a large spike. We would have to dive into this data and see if it holds any weight.

### Duration of Bike Ride

The line graph below shows the duration of bike rides per ride. This is an important graph because you know how long your customer is using your product. From this graph, you can see that most of the riders ride between 0-20 mins. We can use this information to give cheaper prices if you ride the bike longer or vise versa.

### Duration of Bike Ride by Gender

The line graph belows shows a similar store as the previous image. This shows that men make up the largest market cap of the rides. Additionally, the delta between those curves is about 10-15 mins. That means men ride 10 to 15 mins more than women.

### Duration by Hour 

The heat map below shows the busiest times that the bikes are getting used. This could be used to determine an optimum time to do a surge charge. The heat maps shows the busiest times are between 7-8am and 5-6pm and on the weekends, mainly Saturday.

### Trip per week by Gender

The heat map below shows number of trip for each day of the week and it is sorted by Gender. The large take away from this graph is that males use the bikes almost every single day and they are a subcriber to the service.

## Summary 

Overall, based off the anaylsis we preformed the best place to put a city bike is a place that is fairly high density, where you can ride for 20 mins and get someplace and a place that has a bunch of males who are between the age of 25 and 45.

Two more additionally graphs would be neat to look at is type of bike. Is there a market to have a bike with a basket or a bike that has different gear ratio to climb hills in the city. Lastly, I think it would be neat to track actually movement time vs trip duration time. This would give an idea of high trafficed area if there is a bunch of stopage time. In which this data could be used to add another city bike station in the area.
